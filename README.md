# A distributed algorithm to obtain repeated games equilibria with discounting

## Introduction

Code used to obtain the results in the paper Parras, J., and Zazo, S. (2020). A distributed algorithm to obtain repeated games equilibria with discounting. Applied Mathematics and Computation, 367 (2020): 124785. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2019.124785).

## Launch

To run the two main simulations of the paper, execute from MAtLAB the scripts `Communicating_equilibria_testbench` and `Communicating_equilibria_testbench_cost_vs_accuracy`. These two scripts call all functions needed, save the results (overwritting any previous results), and show the plots obtained in the paper.
